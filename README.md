### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**tjjay17/tjjay17** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
My name is Thanooj Jeyanandan and I am currently a fourth year computer engineering student over at Ryerson University!
I think my GitHub does the talking for me ðŸ˜… but my general aim is to learn all about how software development can be applied to practical uses.

Please feel free to check out some of my repositories and check out some of my live websites. 
Stay tuned for more deployed applications as I work through this pot of ideas I have cooking.

My ReadME's contain a demo and also the live website if applicable.
