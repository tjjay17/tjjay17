### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**tjjay17/tjjay17** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
My name is Thanooj Jeyanandan and I am currently a third year computer engineering student over at Ryerson University!
I think my GitHub does the talking for me ðŸ˜… but my general aim is to learn all about how software development can be applied to practical uses.

Please feel free to check out some of my repositories and check out some of my live websites. 
Stay tuned for more deployed applications as I work through this pot of ideas I have cooking.
Here is some of my deployed applications:

Finance-Fix: https://github.com/tjjay17/Finance-Fix-Revamped

Simon Game: https://tjjay17.github.io/The-Simon-Game/

Covid Charts: www.comparecases.me

Note taker: https://vigorous-wescoff-72a15f.netlify.app/

Material-UI Playaround: http://myeventguestlist.s3-website.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/


I am currently working on my biggest application yet - finance fix. Check it out in my repositories and stay tuned for it's deployment.
